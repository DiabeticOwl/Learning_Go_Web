# UUID

A universally unique identifier (UUID) is typically a 128-bit label used for
information in computer systems. The term globally unique identifier (GUID)
is also used.

When generated according to the standard methods, UUIDs are, for practical
purposes, unique. Their uniqueness does not depend on a central registration
authority or coordination between the parties generating them, unlike most
other numbering schemes. While the probability that a UUID will be duplicated
is not zero, it is close enough to zero to be negligible.

Since UUIDs are unique and persistent, they make excellent Uniform Resource
Names. The unique ability to generate a new UUID without a registration
process allows for UUIDs to be one of the URNs with the lowest minting cost.
